# GoHighLevel SPA Routing Solution

## Problem

- Direct URL access doesn't work (e.g., typing `/prototype_pipeline/chat` in browser)
- UI navigation works fine (clicking links)
- Server redirects to `/prototype_pipeline` when file not found

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Hash Router (Recommended for GoHighLevel)

Change from BrowserRouter to HashRouter to avoid server-side routing issues.

### Option 2: Server-side redirects

Create server-side redirects in GoHighLevel (if supported).

### Option 3: URL rewriting

Use URL rewriting to serve index.html for all routes.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Switch to HashRouter** - Most reliable for GoHighLevel
2. **Update all navigation** to use hash-based URLs
3. **Test direct URL access**
4. **Verify developer attribution still works**

## Hash Router Benefits

- ✅ Works with any hosting provider
- ✅ No server-side routing needed
- ✅ Direct URL access works
- ✅ Preserves URL parameters
- ✅ Developer attribution still works
