# Test the routing issue step by step

## Step 1: Test the debug page

Visit: https://xrwebsites.io/prototype_pipeline/routing-debug.html

This will show us:

- Current URL information
- Whether redirects are happening
- What the server is doing

## Step 2: Check the redirects file

The updated \_redirects file should handle:

- /prototype_pipeline/chat → /index.html (200)
- /prototype_pipeline/\* → /index.html (200)

## Step 3: Test direct navigation

Try manually typing in the browser:

```
https://xrwebsites.io/prototype_pipeline/chat?ref=lamont_evans&source=email
```

## Step 4: Check browser network tab

1. Open browser dev tools
2. Go to Network tab
3. Navigate to the chat URL
4. Look for any 301/302 redirects

## Step 5: Check server logs

If you have access to hosting provider logs, check for:

- 301 redirects
- 404 errors
- Server-side redirects

## Possible Issues:

### 1. Hosting Provider Redirect

The hosting provider might be doing a redirect before our app loads.

### 2. React Router Basename Issue

The basename="/prototype_pipeline" might be causing conflicts.

### 3. Build Configuration

The homepage in package.json might be causing issues.

### 4. Server Configuration

The server might not be serving the correct files.

## Next Steps:

1. **Deploy the updated \_redirects file**
2. **Rebuild and redeploy the app**
3. **Test the debug page**
4. **Check if the issue persists**

If the issue persists, we may need to:

- Change the basename configuration
- Update the hosting provider settings
- Use a different routing approach
