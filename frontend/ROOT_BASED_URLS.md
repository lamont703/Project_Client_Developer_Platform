# Updated URL Structure - Root-Based Hosting

## New URL Format

With the home page now at `/` instead of `/prototype_pipeline`, all URLs are simplified:

### Home Page

```
https://xrwebsites.io/
```

### Chat Page with Developer Attribution

```
https://xrwebsites.io/chat?ref=lamont_evans&source=email
```

### Jobs Page

```
https://xrwebsites.io/jobs
```

### Post Job Page

```
https://xrwebsites.io/post-job
```

### Developers Page

```
https://xrwebsites.io/developers
```

### Proto Hub Page

```
https://xrwebsites.io/proto-hub
```

### Developer Chat Page

```
https://xrwebsites.io/developer-chat
```

## Benefits of Root-Based Hosting

- ✅ **Simpler URLs** - No `/prototype_pipeline` prefix needed
- ✅ **Direct URL access works** - No complex routing needed
- ✅ **Developer attribution preserved** - Parameters work correctly
- ✅ **Analytics tracking works** - All events still tracked
- ✅ **Browser back/forward works** - Standard React Router behavior
- ✅ **No server configuration needed** - Works with any hosting

## Testing URLs

After deploying, test these URLs:

1. **Chat with developer attribution:**

   ```
   https://xrwebsites.io/chat?ref=lamont_evans&source=email
   ```

2. **Jobs page:**

   ```
   https://xrwebsites.io/jobs
   ```

3. **Post job page:**
   ```
   https://xrwebsites.io/post-job
   ```

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ URLs should load directly without redirects
- ✅ Developer attribution should be extracted from URL parameters
- ✅ Analytics events should include developer attribution
- ✅ All navigation should work as expected
- ✅ Direct URL access should work for all routes
